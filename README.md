# AoC-2022
Here are my solutions for AoC 2022, not perfect though... Not even barely good, but it works soo....

Since I don't have much time I am not trying to make efficient or extendable code, 
for example there will be a lot of hardcoded values and some things you probably shouldnt do when writing code..., bad programing practices basically.
 
Anyways this code is probably s**t, but I don't care, I'm doing this just for fun.
